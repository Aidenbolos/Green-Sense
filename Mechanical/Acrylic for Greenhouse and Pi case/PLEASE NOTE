You may notice the acrylic files aren't color-coded for inside and outside cuts.

Due to the college/prototype lab closing, I was looking into external companies to get the acrylic cut.

When I called these companies, they did NOT need the files color-coded for each type of cut. This is why the files aren't color-coded.

These quotes ended up being quite expensive, so I moved to an alternative method. And modifying the coloring on the files just hasn't been a priority since.
